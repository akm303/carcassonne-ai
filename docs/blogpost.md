## Motivation
Carcassonne is a game with a very large state space. 

## Problem Statement
We want to build a set of agents using a variety of cutting-edge AI algorithms (such as MCTS, Q-Learning, and Sarsa) to play a two-player game of Carcassonne and score more points than an opponent.

## Related Work
A carcassonne player agent has been implemented before using Monte-carlo tree search:
